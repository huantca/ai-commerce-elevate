    summary: "You probably don't want to leave your customer waiting, confusing when the support teams are unavailable",
    challenge: "Most of the online shopping occurs in the evening, when human support team are typically offline. Shoppers decide within 7-10 seconds whether should spend time and money on your site and when they don't feel it's responsive and supportive enough, they might return straight back to google search with other stores with the same offerings. Cart abandonment is popular with 30% of returns from buyer that feeling unsure at the checkout, the site misses out on the crucial moment of guidance. Let alone the different time zones, weekends or language gaps, the store is losing massive sales potential. For larger expensive goods ⇒ the customers need more assurance and need instantaneous support. The owners are interested in reducing the cost associated with having an employee that has to answer all the questions. But the worker has already worked from 9 to 5 Monday to friday, and the customer is on the website on saturday night at 9 P.M.",
